Programming language: AppleScript

I am not responsible for any damages caused by this script. This script makes your OS X computer reboot infinitely UNLESS you force shutdown your computer by pressing the power button for a few seconds while it's shutting down to restart. After that, restart your computer and click 'No' when it asks you if you want to open the programs which were open when it shut down.

Make sure to check: 'Stay open after run handler' to make the infinite reboot working.
